# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Hi, I’m Kamri. I’m a data professional who enjoys turning messy, real-world information into clear, useful insights. 
I like work that sits between analysis and context — where understanding why something is happening matters just as much as the numbers themselves. 
I’m especially interested in applied analytics and AI, and I enjoy projects that require both structured thinking and interpretation. 
I care about clarity, asking good questions, and making sure the work can actually be understood by people who didn’t write the code. 
Outside of formal projects, I like documenting what I’m learning and building things in public as I grow in data and tech.
